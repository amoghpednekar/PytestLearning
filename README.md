# PyTest Learning

A hands-on learning repository for Python test automation using pytest. This project covers basic assertions, fixtures, fixture scopes, hooks, and simple fixture-based patterns for learning and experimentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pytest installed
- optional: Playwright-related dependencies if you expand the fixture examples further

## Installation

Install the required package:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

Run all tests from the repository root:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Run tests with detailed output:

```bash
pytest -vv -s
```

Run tests from a specific folder:

```bash
pytest Basics -q
pytest Fixtures -q
pytest Fixture_playwright -q
```

Run a single file:

```bash
pytest Basics/test_first.py -q
```

## What You Will Learn

### 1. Basics

Examples in the Basics folder introduce:

- simple assert statements
- string and number comparisons
- basic Python object comparison in tests

### 2. Fixtures

The Fixtures folder demonstrates:

- creating reusable fixtures
- using fixtures in multiple tests
- fixture scopes such as function, module, and session
- setup and teardown using yield

### 3. Fixture-Based Patterns

The Fixture_playwright folder shows how fixtures can be used to organize setup for simple web-page style scenarios and shared test context.

### 4. Parameterized Tests

The Parameterized folder demonstrates:

- using pytest.mark.parametrize to run the same test with different inputs
- combining multiple parameter sets for broader coverage
- using pytest.param with custom IDs and skip marks

## Key Takeaways

- pytest makes it easy to write readable and maintainable tests
- fixtures help avoid duplication in test setup
- fixture scope controls how often setup code runs
- organizing tests into folders improves clarity and structure
- simple example-based projects are a great way to learn automation concepts

## Suggested Next Steps

Once you are comfortable with these examples, you can explore:

- parameterized tests with pytest.mark.parametrize
- custom markers and skip/xfail handling
- more advanced fixture design
- integration with Selenium or Playwright for real browser automation

## Notes

This repository is intended for learning and practice. Feel free to modify the tests, add new examples, and experiment with different pytest patterns.
